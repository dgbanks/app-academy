#### React Concepts:

##### Single Page App
  * only one backend route that renders HTML
  * asynchronous requests send and retrieve data to the backend, and React attempts to update the minimum number of elements

##### Virtual Dom
  *
##### Diffing Algorithm

##### JSX
  * provides syntactic sugar for ```React.createElement(component, props, ...children)```

#### Create React App
  * create apps with no build configuration

  * **registeredServiceWorker**:
    * Progressive Web App

      * Responsive: fits any device
